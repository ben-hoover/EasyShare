# EasyShare

EasyShare is an iOS application that merged userâ€™s Facebook, Twitter, & Instagram feeds into one

This app is no longer updated. It has not been updated to build on the latest Xcode, and new restrictions on Facebook and Instagram APIs prevent the app from ever working again.

The app was developed when I was 14, so it is not an up to date depiction of my coding abilities or style.
